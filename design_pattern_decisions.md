1) Again overflow and underflow I use Solidity 0.8.0 because from that version safeMath is untegral part

2) In my smart contarct I use Pausable a common emergency response mechanism that can pause functionality while developrs try to fige out solution. 

3) Modifier owner to restrict access to widrow function for example.
