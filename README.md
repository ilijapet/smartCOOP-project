## <p align="center"> Smart Contract based agricultural cooperatives </p>


With this project we would like to asses possbilities coming out from blockchain world to address some of the most pressing chalengies small agircultural producers confront. In this project we will offere simplified verison of market reality which is much more complex and nunced then presented here. But still we belive that this exrcesis and model with which we work here have all neccesery elements which can demonstrate some of potentials blockchain tehcnology have for field of agriculture.


## 1) Problem statment

Small producers don't have enough capacity to be effectivly present on market as indivudal producers. That is why they have two option. 

First: organzie themself in tradional cooperatives, improve negotion postion through this self-organizaiton and then enter negotian process with big coorporate buyers or act as independet market actor with own products.

Second: sell as indidivual producer to big corporations under condition often not so favorable to them. 

Both solutions have some drawbacks associted with them. Big coorporation tend to offer price which is basicaly less then avarage session price for small fruits and they pay producers on the end of session. What means that small producers with their goods in a way credit big coorporaitons and in retrun  they get lowest market price for theri row fruit. Then there is also counterparty risk inovolved. Coorporations can delay or entierly avoid their obligaiton to pay small prudcers. Having in mind fact that often corporations have in-house legal depratmens and theri fincial capacity and then on other side lack of specific legal knowlegde and finacial means of small producer to figh legal case agains big corporations, their position as small prudcers is not so good also in this regard. 

On the other hand if they organize themself in form of more tradional cooperatives there is contuterparty risk of missmenagment of cooperative funds or collected goods, high managing cost for runnig traditional coopertive and low overall managment efficency often associated with this type of organizational structure.  

## 2) Some of potenitla benefits of introducing blockchain technology (answers to some chalengies and problems)

> - Get real time market price on the day of selling not lowest average session price
> - Cut diffrent contra party risk (corporative and cooperativ one)
> - Cost effectiv way to manage cooperative
> - Increased number of possbile buyers (In blockcahine you don't need to know or trust buyer or to have already developed relation with them to be abel to effectivly do bussinis with them. This drasticly increas number of potential bussnis partners will lovering legal and logistical cost of doing bussines)
> - Cooperative guaranty found provide full assurance to cooperative members that in case they reject all offers during the session they will recive full price on the day they decide to sell 


## 3) Project assumption:
This project assume that:
> - Agricultural cooperative have fully operational refrigereator (storage of small fruits) and warehous
> - Person responsible for qulity check  
> - Beam scale
> - For purpose and simplicity of this project we will also assume that coopeartive is dealing only with one type of small fruits lets say raspberries

## 4) Graphical represenation of user flow (cooperant/small prducer and buyer)


## 4.1) Textual explanation of step by setp workflow from cooperant and buyer perspective


## 5) Connecting elements from SC to each step in producer/buyer workflow


## 6) Proposed tech stack
