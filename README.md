## <p align="center"> Smart Contract based agricultural cooperative </p>


With this project we would like to asses possbilities coming out from blockchain world to address some of the most pressing chalengies small agircultural producers confront. 

In this project we will offere simplified verison of market reality which is much more complex and nunced then presented here. But still we belive that this exrcesis and model provided have all neccesery elements which can demonstrate some of potential we belive blockhaine tehcnology have for field of agriculture.


## 1) Problem statment

Small producers don't have enough capacity to be effectivly present on market as indivudal producers. That is why they have two option. 

First: organzie themself in tradional cooperatives, improve negotion postion through this self-organizaiton and then enter negotian process with big coorporate buyers or act as independet market actor with own products.

Second: sell as indidivual producer their goods to big corporations under condition often not so favorable to them. 

Both solutions have some drawbacks. 

Big coorporation tened to offer price to small producer which is basicaly less then avarage session price of small fruits and they pay them on the end of session. What means that small producers with their goods in a way credit big coorporaitons for bascialy lowest market price for row fruites they can get. Then there is also contra party risk inovolved: coorporations can delay or entierly avoid their obligaiton to pay small prudcers. Having in mind fact that often corporations have in-hosue legal depratmens and theri fincial capacity and then on other side lack of specific legal knowlegde and finacial means of small producer to figh legal case agains big corporations, their position as small prudcers in this constelaiton is not so favorible for them. 

On the other hand if they organize them-self in the form of tradional cooperatives there is always contra party risk of missmenagment of cooperative funds or collected goods, high mangaing cost of runnig traditional coopertive and low overall managment efficency.  

## 2) Main potenitla benefits (answers to chalengies and problems)
(NAPRAVITI OVDE PO CRTICAMA U MD)

Get real time market price on the day of selling not lowest average session price
Cut diffrent contra party risk (company and cooperativ one)
Cost effective way to managment cooperative
Increase number of possbile buyers (in blockcahine you don't need to know or trust buyer or to have developed relation wiht them. This drasticly increas number of potential busnis partners will lovering legal cost of doing bussines - developing special Contracts)
Cooperative guaranty found provide fulla assurance to small producer member of cooperative that in case he reject all offers during the session he will recive full price on the day he decide to sell 


## 3) Assumption:
Cooperative have fully functional refrigereator (storage of small fruits) and warehous
Person responsible for qulity check workig to receive goods from cooperative members 
Beam scale
For purpose of this project we will assume that coopeartive is dealing only with one type of small fruits. Lets say raspberries

## 4) Graphical represenation of user flow (cooperant/small prducer and buyer)


## 4.1) Textual eplanation of step by setp workflow from copoperan and buyer perspective


## 5) Connect elements in SC to each step from workflow


## 6) Proposed tech stack
