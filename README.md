## <p align="center"> Smart Contract based agricultural cooperative </p>


With this project we would like to asses possbilities coming out from blockchain world to address some of the most pressing chalengies small agircultural producers confront. In this project we will offere simplified verison of market reality which is much more complex and nunced then presented here. But still we belive that this exrcesis and presented model have all neccesery elements which can demonstrate some of potentials blockchain tehcnology have for field of agriculture.


## 1) Problem statment

Small producers don't have enough capacity to be effectivly present on market as indivudal producers. That is why they have two option. 

First: organzie themself in tradional cooperatives, improve negotion postion through this self-organizaiton and then enter negotian process with big coorporate buyers or act as independet market actor with own products.

Second: sell as indidivual producer their goods to big corporations under condition often not so favorable to them. 

Both solutions have some drawbacks. 

Big coorporation tened to offer price which is basicaly less then avarage session price of small fruits and they pay them on the end of session. What means that small producers with their goods credit big coorporaitons for lowest market price they can get for their row fruites. Then there is also contra party risk inovolved. Coorporations can delay or entierly avoid their obligaiton to pay small prudcers. Having in mind fact that often corporations have in-hosue legal depratmens and theri fincial capacity and then on other side lack of specific legal knowlegde and finacial means of small producer to figh legal case agains big corporations, their position as small prudcers in this constelaiton is not so favorible for them. 

On the other hand if they organize them-self in the form of tradional cooperatives there is always contra party risk of missmenagment of cooperative funds or collected goods, high mangaing cost of runnig traditional coopertive and low overall managment efficency.  

## 2) Main potenitla benefits of introducing blockchain technology (answers to chalengies and problems)
(NAPRAVITI OVDE PO CRTICAMA U MD)

Get real time market price on the day of selling not lowest average session price
Cut diffrent contra party risk (company and cooperativ one)
Cost effectiv way to manage cooperative
Increased number of possbile buyers (in blockcahine you don't need to know or trust buyer or to have already developed relation wiht them. This drasticly increas number of potential bussnis partners will lovering legal cost of doing bussines - developing special Contracts and contra party risk)
Cooperative guaranty found provide full assurance to member of cooperative that in case he reject all offers during the session he will recive full price on the day he decide to sell 


## 3) Assumption:
This project assume that:
Cooperative have fully functional refrigereator (storage of small fruits) and warehous
Person responsible for qulity check  
Beam scale
For purpose of this project and simplicity we will also assume that coopeartive is dealing only with one type of small fruits. Lets say raspberries

## 4) Graphical represenation of user flow (cooperant/small prducer and buyer)


## 4.1) Textual eplanation of step by setp workflow from copoperan and buyer perspective


## 5) Connect elements in SC to each step from workflow


## 6) Proposed tech stack
